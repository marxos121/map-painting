# Overview

A logical game where your goal is to find a path around all stones from a starting point and water the available patch to let flowers bloom! 

## How to play
  Use WSAD or arrow keys to expand from the "head" - which is either the starting position or the position you last "expanded into".
  Press F5 to toggle between fullscreen and windowed modes.


## Designing levels
  Set height and width. 
  Add next step in the path by clicking on an empty block that's directly above or to the left or right of the current head position.
  You can remove changes by either clicking on the head of the waterpath or on the "Undo" button.
  Once the path is ready, save your level. Blocks which are not included in the path will be converted to stones and your level will be queued as the final level.
  You can change the order of the maps by changing filenames in Maps/ folder or adjusting the "NEXT" property inside map files.
